I'm a student of Mathematics at the National University of Colombia.

I'm interested in Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Geometry.

In my spare time (which sadly it's not that much), I drink coffee, eat cookies and play [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29).

This site was built using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), an awesome fast and flexible static site generator written in the [Go Programming Language](http://golang.org/).

The theme you see is based on [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde).
